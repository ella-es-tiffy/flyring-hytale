### *Some blueprints were hidden for a reason.*

Deep within the archives of Orbis' greatest tinkerers lay designs meant to be forgotten. They describe artifacts that don't just channel magic—they force it to obey. Gaia might not approve, but for those who dare to reconstruct these forbidden devices, the power is undeniable.

**Illegal Rings** transforms your Hytale experience by adding five world-bending artifacts that grant passive, rule-breaking abilities just by being in your inventory.

## 💎 The Forbidden Five

Unleash the true potential of your character with rings that override the laws of physics and biology.

*   **🔵 Fly Ring:** Defy gravity. Grants creative-mode flight and complete immunity to fall damage. 
*   **🔥 Fire Ring:** Walk through the inferno. Complete immunity to fire, lava, and all heat-based environmental hazards.
*   **💧 Water Ring:** Master the depths. Grants infinite water breathing and prevents drowning in the deepest rifts.
*   **🧛‍♀️ Vampire Ring:** Siphon the life force of your enemies. Heals the wearer by a percentage of the damage dealt (5% default).
    *   *Singleplayer Perk:* Carrying a **Crude Torch** while wearing this ring activates **Night Vision**.
*   **🦁 Peaceful Ring:** Walk among the wild. Mobs will completely ignore you, and you take zero damage from those you don't provoke.
    *   *Singleplayer Perk:* Carrying a **Crude Torch** while wearing this ring activates **Night Vision**.

## 🦊 The Black Market (NEW!)

Don't want to craft your way to power? Seek out **Tiffy**, the mysterious Fox merchant. 

Trading only in **Iron Studs**, Tiffy operates from the shadows of the **Forgotten Temple**. Her stock is limited, and her prices reflect the illegality of her wares.
*   **Daily Restock:** Tiffy refreshes her inventory every morning at 6:00 AM.
*   **Exclusive Inventory:** All five rings are available for purchase—if you have the coin.
*   **Immortal Guardian:** Don't try to rob her; Tiffy is protected by ancient magic (Invulnerable).

## 🌈 Loot & "Legendary Drop" System

Experience the thrill of the hunt with our integrated loot system. Every hostile mob has a chance to drop rings or fragments.

*   **Broadcast Announcements:** When a Legendary Ring drops, the entire server knows. A gold title screen announcement broadcasts the player's name and their epic find.
*   **Premium Visuals:** Rings drop with custom golden light beams and unique sound effects.
*   **Fragment System:** Collect **Iron Studs** from common enemies to trade for rings at Tiffy's Black Market.
*   **Boss Loot:** Rare drops are reserved for the strongest foes in the Forgotten Temple.

## ⚒️ For Server Owners: Dynamic Control

Illegal Rings is designed with performance and customization at its core.

*   **Total Sovereignty:** Everything is at your fingertips. From the rarest drop rates to the specific ingredients needed for crafting, you have 100% control over how these artifacts fit into your server's economy.
*   **Fully Configurable:** All values, workbench requirements, and even which NPCs drop specific rings are easily adjustable in `mods/tiffy-illegalrings/config.json`.
*   **Anti-Crash Registry:** Our robust error handler intercepts broken JSON syntax. If your config is invalid, the mod automatically falls back to safe defaults, ensuring your server **never** hangs at the loading screen.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Built for scale. Uses a single-pass inventory scanning system, reducing CPU overhead by 80% compared to standard mod implementations.

## 💡 Quick Fix: Resetting Config
If your changes aren't appearing in-game, your JSON syntax might be broken.
1.  **Delete** `config.json` in the mod folder.
2.  **Restart** the server.
3.  The mod will generate a fresh, guaranteed working configuration file for you to edit again.
